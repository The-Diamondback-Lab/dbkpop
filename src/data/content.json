  "University of Maryland senior Patty Pelingon's laptop is covered in stickers. There's one for \"The Mighty Sound of Maryland\" marching band, a Testudo shell and the Phillipine flag.",
  "VIDEO::videos/large.mp4",
  "CAPTION::Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Leo vel orci porta non. Et tortor at risus viverra. Mattis molestie a iaculis at. Pellentesque adipiscing commodo elit at imperdiet dui accumsan sit. Tellus at urna condimentum mattis pellentesque.",
  "But in their midst are other emblems that fewer people would recognize at first glance: A young man holding a mug and making a funny face, an artistic drawing of a flower. If you know, you know. And if you don't, you don't. These stickers are references to the K-pop band BTS — and Pelingon is a big fan.",
  "But she chose these stickers because they wouldn't easily out her as a Korean pop fan.",
  "\"I still find myself hesitant to admit it in certain contexts. Like, some classes will tell you, 'Oh, share a fun fact about yourself,'\" said Pelingon, an anthropology and biology major. \"That will never be my [fun fact].\"",
  "Over the last few years, K-pop — fueled by boy and girl bands with coordinated dance routines — has spread around the world. But all the while, both at this university and across America, K-pop's sometimes-cutesy, sometimes-flashy style has drawn derision at times.",
  "Spotify reported a 1,000 percent increase in K-pop streams between January 2014 and April 2019 alone. In 2018 and 2019, five K-pop songs without features — and another five including features from American artists — made the Billboard Top 100 charts.",
  "In particular, a lot of hype surrounds South Korean boy band BTS, which stands for Bangtan Sonyeondan or — in English — Bulletproof Boy Scouts. BTS has become a global phenomenon, even winning honors at some of America's most prestigious awards shows, beginning with the Billboard's Top Social Artist in 2017.",
  "In 2019, BTS made its debut at No. 43 on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list. According to Forbes, the group made $57 million before taxes in 2019, surpassing some of the biggest American pop stars, such as Ariana Grande, who made $48 million last year.",
  "Meanwhile, at this university, K-pop dance groups are burgeoning. Yet many students, like Pelingon, still sport their love for the music in subtle ways.",
  "\"Many different types of foreign music have faced the challenge of a stigma in mainstream America,\" said Adam Wojciechowicz, public affairs specialist for the Korean Cultural Center in Washington, D.C. \"Such stigmas can result from a lack of familiarity, the barrier of many nonverbal cultural attributes and differences that make complex performances what they are, and sometimes discrimination.\"",
  "But it seems that this campus' best kept secret is K-pop. Fans can be found anywhere — you just have to know where to look.",
  "HEADER::K-pop on this Campus",
  "It was a warm Friday evening at the end of September, and while the tailgate for the football team's sold-out match-up against Penn State raged on, some students gathered in Dance Studio 1 at the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center instead.",
  "The diverse group of students lined up in rows of four and five, nearly filling the studio. They were convened for something worlds apart from the hamburgers and Natty Lites in the parking lot outside — a K-pop dance workshop.",
  "They were getting ready to learn choreography from a video by 1Million studio to \"요즘것들\" — which translates to These Days. And it was organized by campus dance group G-Girls & the Wasabi Boyz, a club that's seen its attendance steadily increase over the past few years, said Paxon Yu, the group's senior advisor.",
  "\"It might just be the momentum of a growing club. But it's also definitely just K-pop becoming more mainstream,\" said Yu, a senior computer science major.",
  "Students in the club teach dance routines created by Asian choreographers, or for songs by Asian artists. Lately though, many of the requests from new club-goers have been K-pop songs, said Junie Wu, the dance group's administrative director.",
  "\"We get a lot of freshmen. And the younger kids, they now know BTS. The big thing, right?\" said Wu, a senior physiology and neurobiology major. \"It's a good thing. They get introduced to music, and then maybe through our club we can introduce them to more niche songs that they can get into.\"",
  "During the workshop, the song slowly dragged through the air, playing at half-speed to make learning the choreography easier. Junior Jae Jung led the group, step by step, as some stumbled and laughed while others kept their eyes glued to the mirror in focus.",
  "GGWB creative director Yuxiang Lai said when the club started in 2011, there were only seven people, but the club has rapidly grown. Club members even perform some of their choreography at local events and competitions.",
  "\"I've seen sort of an increase, because the first workshop we had our entire studio was packed,\" the sophomore studio art major said.",
  "One of K-pop's biggest draws is the prominent role of dance. Every K-pop idol — the common term for K-pop stars — has to know how to dance, and each and every song is meticulously choreographed for concerts and music videos. Fans are drawn in, not least because they can get in on the fun, too.",
  "\"When you have a group dance, and you get a couple of your friends, get down, dance together, there's more bonding,\" Yu said.",
  "The campus K-pop community is vibrant, but students still feel apprehensive that the university community won't be so welcoming.",
  "Veronica Iglesias, a junior Spanish major, has BT21 pins on her backpack, K-pop stickers on her laptop and even a BT21 sweater, but she often thinks twice about sporting her merch on the campus.",
  "\"Should I cover it up? But then at the same time, I'm restricting myself from doing something that I want to do,\" Iglesias said. \"But if I'm gonna wear it in public, why wouldn't I wear it on campus?\"",
  "Students have also noticed that K-pop can sometimes be the only exposure people have to Korean culture. For Korean students like Kyle Cho, this can be a nice conversation starter, but it can also be challenging. Practically every time Cho mentions he's Korean, he gets the same question: \"Do you listen to K-pop?\"",
  "\"Especially last year at the start of college, I was kind of bombarded with those questions. And it gets kind of exhausting,\" Cho said. \"I'm not a library of information about K-pop just because I'm Korean.\"",
  "HEADER::A K-pop history",
  "In the U.S., it's hard to ignore the ghost of K-pop's past: PSY's \"Gangnam Style.\" The song won global recognition back in 2012 for its ridiculous music video and signature galloping dance move.",
  "The video became YouTube's most watched of all time, although it's since been dethroned by the likes of \"Despacito\" and \"Baby Shark.\" Now, it rests comfortably at No. 7.",
  "Originally, YouTube's view counter could only reach about two billion, but after \"Gangnam Style\" surpassed that tally, the company updated its algorithm to count far higher.",
  "Cho, a Maryland native who attends Elon University, said \"Gangnam Style\" led many people to dismiss K-pop as silly. But since BTS' global rise to fame, he's noticed the genre is gaining broader legitimacy. Nowadays, he can even find K-pop CDs at Target, he said.",
  "\"I feel like it's just people are taking it more seriously now, as like, an actual entry into the music industry rather than a one-time thing,\" Cho said.",
  "In Korea, K-pop is a part of what is known as the Hallyu wave — the global rise of South Korean pop culture dating back to the 1990s. Wojciechowicz said Korea's cultural impact abroad has become an important aspect of the country's place in global affairs.",
  "\"A lot of people think pop-culture is just fluff, it's just background music — something to enjoy in your spare time — and it may be that,\" Wojciechowicz said. \"But it's also a big industry and a big part of Korea's image abroad.\"",
  "Gyu Tag Lee, a professor at George Mason University's Korean campus who studies Korean and American pop culture, said K-pop didn't formally exist as a genre until the late 1990s, when newly popular Korean dance music became globalized — specifically when other East Asian countries started listening too.",
  "\"The term K-Pop was given by the global audience or media, rather than the domestic ones,\" Lee said.",
  "Since the 90s, K-pop has dramatically changed. K-pop history is divided into what is called \"generations\" — starting in 1992 with the debut of groups like Seo Taiji and Boys, which are considered part of the \"first generation.\" These original K-pop bands blended Western rap and hip-hop with the Korean language and created elaborate choreography and music videos to go along with it.",
  "Today, K-pop has many sub-genres influenced by pop music from around the world. Electronic dance music and synth-pop influences can be found in most mainstream K-pop hits. Rap also remains a big part of the genre — most boy and girl groups have at least one designated rapper. K-R&B has emerged as another version of Western-influenced music in Korea.",
  "One K-pop boy band that draws from EDM, rap and R&B influences is known as NCT 127, a group whose popularity closely rivals that of BTS both at home and abroad.",
  "The rise of social media has also added to K-pop artists' success. Korean artists put out a lot of video content on YouTube and other platforms, from dance practices to guest starring on Korean variety shows, to vlogging. Every aspect of their lives is broadcasted to a passionate and content-hungry audience.",
  "Junior government and politics major Arona Baigal discovered K-pop from watching her favorite YouTube channel, Fine Bros Entertainment. In June 2019, they posted a video with NCT 127 called \"K-pop Stars React To Try Not To Sing Along Challenge\" and when Baigal watched it, she fell in love.",
  "\"I just went into like the deepest, darkest, not darkest, just a huge YouTube black hole of their videos,\" she said. \"And I was like, this is the craziest thing ever.\"",
  "Nick Kim, a senior computer science major, said people keep up with their favorite K-pop artists through V Live, a website that hosts live broadcasting and chatting. It allows fans to get to know artists, like BTS lead RM, on an almost-personal level, Kim said.",
  "\"'RM is like the coolest person ever, I want to be like him.' I think that is like such a key aspect to why people are attracted to K-pop,\" Kim said.",
  "HEADER::The Stanning and the Stigma",
  "Veronica Iglesias proudly displays a photo of three BTS idols on her phone case: J-hope, Jungkook and V. Once people realize the photo's of a K-pop band, they often ask, \"Why would you listen to K-pop if you can't understand what they're saying?\"",
  "One of her co-workers even took the scorn a step further and wore a t-shirt sporting the words \"I hate K-pop\" in English and in Korean to work one day.",
  "That reaction, while uniquely overt, isn't altogether unfamiliar for K-pop fans. Overwhelmingly, fans at the University of Maryland cited the language barrier as a reason their interest in the genre has confused their peers.",
  "\"Some people I know definitely think I'm weird for liking it. Which I don't get because 'Despacito' did really well in America. That song was a majority in Spanish,\" Baigal said.",
  "But another factor proved equally important in defining the negativity that surrounds K-pop fans — their online presence.",
  "K-pop has come to be defined by its army of online fans and their barrage of social media comments, which frequently bring K-pop memes and music into conversations about topics altogether different, drawing disdain — and even anger.",
  "A lot of times, these replies are harmless, garnering attention from fellow K-pop fans who end up fangirling together. But sometimes, K-pop fans — or stans, as they are commonly known — become vitriolic by bullying those they think aren't properly supporting their favorite artists. So, many people outside of the fandom are turned off by K-pop. Initially, Baigal was too.",
  "\"It's just the fans on Twitter take over the entire app and make the genre seem unbearable to everyone,\" Baigal said. \"I appreciate the community that they feel online, but it gets so toxic. This might be why I didn't want to get into K-pop in the first place.\"",
  "Cho said he felt a similar trepidation toward stans because of how prevalent 'toxic' fans appear to be online.",
  "\"They, as a vocal minority, kind of make me a little bit apprehensive towards anyone who tells me that they're a K-pop fan,\" Cho said. \"I just always have this slight fear that 'Uh oh, what if they're kind of insane about it?'\"",
  "Brittany Tinaliga, an alumna of the University of San Francisco, tried to explain this phenomenon in her master's thesis on the competitiveness K-pop fans feel within their fandom. During her research, she found that the K-pop fandom has what's known as \"biopower\" — the structure of the fandom is built from the bottom up — so fans often have an unusually strong influence over artists' success.",
  "Fans will often band together and create strategies to get certain songs and albums to number one, from buying physical CDs in bulk, to streaming music around the clock. Some fans go so far as to raise money to buy ad space on billboards for their favorite artists.",
  "This intensity and passion has helped K-pop become the phenomenon it is today, but sometimes the competition can become unhealthy. Tinaliga found when fans invest parts of their identity into their favorite band, things can become \"toxic\" online, resulting in Twitter wars and efforts to sabotage other fandoms.",
  "\"When a personal sense of accomplishment and their identity is super strongly tied to the successes and image of their idol and fandom, I found that these are the people that were more likely to engage in problematic or 'toxic' fandom activities,\" Tinaliga said.",
  "The negative stereotype that shadows K-pop can be a result of these activities, she said.",
  "\"For some reason that seems to really get on the nerves of people that might not have seen K-pop that much, might not be familiar with K-pop, just because it's kind of like an intrusion, like why can't you just enjoy the music?\" Tinaliga said.",
  "Wojciechowicz noted many different types of foreign music face stigma on the road to becoming mainstream in America. He wrote in an email that stigmas can come from a lack of familiarity with the culture in question, and sometimes discrimination. However, he added bands like BTS who make an active effort to bridge cultural gaps have helped decrease the stigma in recent years.",
  "\"Mainstream acceptance is a pretty high bar though, and to the degree it has already occurred for Korean pop music is pretty impressive and unique as an accomplishment,\" Wojciechowicz wrote.",
  "For now, students like Iglesias and Pelingon will flirt with subtle ways to express their love for K-pop. And others will join one of the few dance groups on this campus where they can enter the K-pop world without judgment.",
  "What matters in the end is the music, despite all the noise from \"toxic fans\" and people who just don't get it – and it's what keeps K-pop fans coming for more.",
  "\"This is really cheesy, but music transcends culture, transcends languages. Even if I can't understand it … there's just something about when you hear the music, you just really feel good about it,\" Pelingon said."
